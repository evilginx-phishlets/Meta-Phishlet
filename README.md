# Meta Phishlet: Utilizing Evilginx for Phishing Simulations

The **Meta phishlet** for **Evilginx** is an essential tool for penetration testers and security researchers aiming to conduct phishing simulations targeting Meta platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. Evilginx, a sophisticated man-in-the-middle attack framework, is designed to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) and capture session tokens, making it highly effective for phishing attacks.

## What is Evilginx?

[Evilginx](https://evilginx.net) is an open-source phishing framework that acts as a proxy, capturing the interactions between users and legitimate login pages. By obtaining login credentials and session cookies, Evilginx allows attackers to circumvent MFA protections, which is particularly relevant for Meta platforms that prioritize user security.

## Why Use the Meta Phishlet?

The **Meta phishlet** enables security professionals to simulate phishing attacks against some of the largest social media platforms in the world. As Meta accounts often implement robust MFA measures, using this phishlet helps organizations identify vulnerabilities in their security protocols and improve their defenses against phishing attempts that could lead to unauthorized account access.

## Setting Up Evilginx with the Meta Phishlet

To deploy the **Meta phishlet**, you'll first need to install [Evilginx](https://evilginx.net) on your server. The Meta phishlet mimics the official login pages of Meta services, allowing Evilginx to capture session cookies and credentials in real time, effectively bypassing MFA protections.
